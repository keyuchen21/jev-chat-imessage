"""Configuration — one set of names, one format, three places to look.

All personal settings live OUTSIDE the repository (so `git add -A` can never leak a key).
The format is always shell-style `KEY=value`; only the search order varies, because this app
is both a .app and a terminal tool:

    1. real environment      wins over everything (good for a one-off override)
    2. ~/.config/jev-imessage/env            <- where the README tells you to put your keys
    3. <project>/.env                      <- for working on the repo itself

Both system conventions are searched for that `env` file, since the app is a GUI bundle and
a CLI tool at once:

    macOS native (GUI apps)   ~/Library/Application Support/jev-imessage/   <- also holds the venv
    dev-tool convention       ~/.config/jev-imessage/   (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jev-imessage/)

One format (`env`), one file to remember. Deliberately not two: a second accepted file with
the same setting names is how you end up carefully editing the one nothing reads.

The names are the conventional ones you likely already export for other tools:

    TYPESAFE_API_KEY     TypeSafe Jev — the "mouthless" model that judges intent + risk
    TYPESAFE_BASE_URL    default https://api.typesafe.ai   (gateways: see README)
    TYPESAFE_MODEL       default jev-latest

    OPENAI_API_KEY       reply-candidate generation, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
    OPENAI_BASE_URL      e.g. https://api.deepseek.com, http://localhost:11434/v1
    OPENAI_MODEL         e.g. deepseek-chat, glm-4-flash, qwen2.5:7b

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY    same job, for Anthropic-compatible endpoints instead
    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL
    ANTHROPIC_MODEL

    LLM_MODEL            shared model name, used when the per-provider one is absent
